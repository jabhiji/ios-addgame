ios-addgame
===========

This is a Xcode 5.1.1 project for a simple "add the numbers" game, based on the awesome book "Tap, Move, Shake" by Todd Moore.


Note that there are some minor changes from the code described in the book:

1.
Use @synthesize to create getter and setter functions for the properties in your implementation file

@implementation ViewController

@synthesize label;
@synthesize answer;
@synthesize result;

.
.
.
.
@end

otherwise the code will not be able to access variable properties using the "." notation.

2.
For avoiding memory leaks by disposing off resources that can be recreated, the 

- (void) viewDidUnload 

method has been deprecated and you should use 

- (void) didReceiveMemoryWarning

instead.

3.
The alerts used in the book have been replaced by an additional label at the bottom.
